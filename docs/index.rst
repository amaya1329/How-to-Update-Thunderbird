How to Update Thunderbird
=========================

Updating Thunderbird is a simple process, and the software is designed to notify users whenever a new update is available. The exact method of updating depends on the operating system you are using.

1. **Automatic Updates** (Recommended)

Thunderbird is designed to automatically check for updates and install them without any input from the user. To ensure that your software remains up to date, follow these steps to enable automatic updates:

- Open Thunderbird.
- Go to **Tools** in the menu bar and select **Options** (Windows/Linux) or **Preferences** (macOS).
- Under the **Advanced** tab, select the **Update** option.
- Ensure that the checkbox for **Automatically install updates** is checked.

This setting allows Thunderbird to automatically download and install updates in the background, ensuring you are always using the latest version without needing to manually check for updates.

2. **Manual Updates**

If you prefer to manually install updates, Thunderbird allows you to do so. Here's how:

- Open Thunderbird.
- Click on the **Menu** button (three horizontal lines) located in the upper-right corner of the window.
- Select **Help** and then **About Thunderbird**.
- Thunderbird will check for available updates. If an update is found, the system will prompt you to install it.
- Click **Restart Thunderbird** to apply the update.

This method gives users more control over when updates are applied, which may be preferred in environments where stability and control are priorities.

3. **Updating Thunderbird on Linux**

For users who installed Thunderbird using a package manager on Linux, you can update it using the terminal. Open a terminal window and enter one of the following commands, depending on your distribution:

- For Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade thunderbird
